The Fastip app can be downloaded by this repository
https://github.com/ptraeg/mobile-apps-4-ways

I have built the apps for Android and iOS platform, and these are located in app folder.

To inspect iOS elements I'm using Macaca App Inspector project

Issue with Appium 1.6.3
https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent/issues/372

Please downgrade Appium to 1.6.2 or use a version > 1.6.3 if available

P.S:
In my case, that I've installed Appium on MacOSX with sudo, I've executed the following command (give write access to node_modules):
sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/lib/node_modules
